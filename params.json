{"name":"EDACC","tagline":"Experiment Design and Administration for Computer Clusters","body":"EDACC is a framework for the design, execution and analysis of large experiments with arbitrary algorithms on computer clusters.\r\n\r\nThe framework consists of 3 major (core) components:\r\n* Database: Stores information about algorithm executables, problem instances and experiments\r\n* [GUI application](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_gui): Java GUI application for managing algorithms and problem instances, creating and analyzing experiments\r\n* [Computation Client](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_client): Responsible for the execution of the algorithms on remote, distributed systems such as computer clusters\r\n\r\nOptional components:\r\n* [Web Frontend](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_web): Web client to perform monitoring and statistical analysis of experiment results\r\n* Job server: Small application that increases the throughput of the system when large-scale grids are used\r\n* Visualizer: Visualize the configuration process of algorithms and to analyze the results\r\n* [Automatic algorithm configurator API](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_api): Java API for parallel automatic algorithm configurators\r\n* [eAAC](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_aac): Automatic configurator framework, which includes several automatic algorithm configurators\r\n\r\nSource code\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nEDACC is free, open-source software and available at [Github](https://github.com/EDACC/).\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nA preliminary [user guide](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_user_guide/raw/master/user_guide.pdf) is available.\r\n\r\nApplications\r\n------------\r\n\r\nEDACC was used to organize the [SAT Challenge 2012](http://baldur.iti.kit.edu/SAT-Challenge-2012/) ([Web Frontend](http://edacc2.informatik.uni-ulm.de/SATChallenge2012/experiments/)) and the [SAT Competition 2013](http://www.satcompetition.org/2013/) ([Web Frontend](https://edacc4.informatik.uni-ulm.de/SC13/experiments/)).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
